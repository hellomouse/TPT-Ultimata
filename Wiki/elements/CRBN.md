# CRBN
### Carbon Dust

*Superconducting CRBN* wire.

**Description:**  *Carbon dust. Turns into RDMD under heat and pressure, superconducts when cold.*

A light conductive powder. Sublimes at 3600 C into CO2. If temperature is greater than 2500 C and pressure greater than 100 there's a chance CRBN will condense into RDMD. When mixed with molten IRON will convert it into molten METL. Burns slowly. Absorbs neutrons.

If it's temperature < 100 K it acts as a superconductor (like INST, but without the need for PSCN or NSCN). In order to superconduct, the point that recieves the SPRK must be touching *at most* 2 other CRBN (no thick wires). However, the middle portion can be as thick as you want.

If tmp2 > 0, CRBN will "act" like a solid, not moving. This makes it useful for liquid filters and wires.

Reactions:
- Purifies WATR into DSTW and salt water into either DSTW or SALT.
- When burnt with H2 turns into GAS (Kind of useless since the GAS instantly ignites)
- When burnt produces CO2

## Technical
#### Properties
**life:** Used for SPRK, same as other conductors

**tmp:** Used to randomize powder color, default from 0 to 6

**tmp2:** Should it act solid?
