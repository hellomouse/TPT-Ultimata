**Description:**  *Neon Gas. Diffuses and conductive. Invisible until sparked, glows with dcolour.*

A gas that's invisible until sparked, then it glows with its dcolour (Default: red). Unlike NBLE, it doesn't heat up.

Cools into SFLD (Superfluid) at 27.15 K. Undergoes fusion at 9000 C and 220 pressure, boosting the local pressure by 30, increasing 
self temperature to 9999 K and transforming into NBLE or OXYG.

## Technical
