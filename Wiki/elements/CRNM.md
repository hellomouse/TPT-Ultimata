**Description:**  *Carolinium. Used to create long burning dark fire bombs. Explodes in layers.*

A glowing solid. Reacts violently to FIRE and PLSM, causing it to "ignite". Upon ignition, every 10 frames, it will release a violent burst of pressure and spawn randomly either DFLM or PLSM (in 50-50 proportions) in any free spaces around it. It does this 10 times, before triggering the next layer to ignite, creating an "onion" layer like effect.

Melts into LAVA at a temperature of 4000 C. LAVA does not ignite CRNM.

CRNM is not to be underestimated, as it releases nearly-invisible DFLM, a slow burning VIRS like flame that burns through almost all materials. CRNM's color reduces in brightness to near black as detonation stages progress.

## Technical
#### Properties
**life:** Current detonation stage. Ends at 10, if greater than 0 will detonate. At life = 9 will ignite nearby CRNM that's not already detonated.
