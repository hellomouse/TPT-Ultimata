**Description:**  *Jacob1. Attacks FIGH.*

Jacob1 is an STKM shaped energy particle that attacks any FIGH on screen. His primary weapons are a pair of heavy microwave lasers, which can superheat and burn through anything except DMND, CLNE, and some other materials. If there is only 1 FIGH on screen only one laser will target it (2nd will turn off), otherwise the lasers will select different targets.

JCB1 also has some auxillary guided missiles, which accelerate towards the FIGH, leaving smoke trails. Upon reaching the location it will turn into a particle of BOMB. When not attacking JCB1 creates a circular force field around him.

JCB1 will also announce TPT propoganda, cycling his set of quotes every few seconds. The quotes are as follows:
```
