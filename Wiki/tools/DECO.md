# DECO

**Description:**  *Sets the dcolour of non-decorated particles to its element color.

Does what the description says. For example, if you have a non-decorated piece of COAL, and you apply this tool, it will have a dcolour that's the same color as COAL (Dark gray). Useful for landscapers who want to smudge or add colors and want to use the original element color.
