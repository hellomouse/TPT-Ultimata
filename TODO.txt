Lanthanum-this ones exciting, for I could see this bridging the gap between solids and solid explosives.
 I was thinking that this element would be a solid metal that when exposed to high temperature flame,
  It would release small pieces of bomb and flame, somewhat like thermite and TNT combined.
   It would only explode into such pieces in small sections at a time. Like regular metal except it's
    slightly explosive. This one needs more work.


realistic stars 
- types:
- neutron stars
- white dwaves 
- red dwarf
- yellow sun
- red supergiant 
- blue aelly big ones

star starts at sun mass
u can add HYGN or NBLE to make it grow!
star grows larger and becomes blue
once fusion cycle eats up it becomes either red giant or redsupergiant

planets engage in n body motaton around stars, stars n body motion other stars

entire blackhole should glow when struck by a particle
- if energy glow white
also release hwaking radiation?

red giant becomes white dwarf or maybe supernova
supergiant goes supernova and collapses either into black hole or neutron star

if blackholes collide glow

mass can be sucked away by gravity

data/intro text fori ntro blurb
- wth mod changes 


MOVING SOLIDS 
--------------------------
2.5 torque
3. rotation
torque can be approximated by taking a grid sample of solids across the solid
- grid should start at a particle in the solid to guarente at least 1 sample

wiki: if tmp > 0 then it will NOT pressure MVSD

use RNG::Ref() 

^ Please use. GCC RNG is slow and has a several kb state. TPT rng takes a few clockcycles and only uses 1 dword of RAM

Potentially repurpose vehicle code to add AI creatures.

aliens - evil AI that need to be killed

sophon
- breaks entanglement
- instanteous communication

How to add new icon
do not used the precompiled
1. cd font
2. make editor unpacker packer
3. ./unpacker > output1.txt
4. ./editor
5. Press + until u reach empty (looks like thermoeter)
6. Draw, then exit
7. rm font.h
8. ./unpacker > font.h
9. go to output1.txt, see last line whats the hex code
10. conversion: convert hex to decimal, add 57194, convert back to hex
11. copy ur font.h into data/font.cpp and add extern const in front of the arrays. Be careful NOT to delete the header or last couple lines
12. simulation./SimulationData.cpp is where u add the hex code u calculated earlier to menu


Write guide for FFGN




fancy black holes
- suck in solids too



realistic shields for spaceship
FFGN coat like SHLD



soviet save :D
- with anthem


INFO element who made the mod 
- draw art

write guide about quantum 
have lua mod to place down quantum gates?
- or website?


Two more particlemaps
electric field

2 row elements?



Spaceships
- Ships have a unique id and allegiance so they can battle eachother
- Components communicate with eachother via FILT network inside the ship
which operates using flood fill to transfer data
- Each component is assigned an ID in network
-- HULL, Hull, Hull of the ship
-- COTR, Controller
   - Fires signal once every three frames so components can update and communicate
   - Stores component id's
   - Tells each component when to use the FILT network
   - Components write data after COTR sends data. if no data is received then we can assume componenet has been destroyed
   and remove it from the set of component id's
   - Control signals (FILT has 32 bit CTYPE)     
     001: FIRE, <componentID:8>00000000, Maximum number of components that can be connected is 255
     010: CONNECT, <particleID:16>0000000000000000, Component is added. Passes particle id or maybe mod of it?
     011: ASSIGN, <particleID:16>0000000000000000> <componentID:8> 00000000, Assigns componentID
-- RADR, Radar, Finds enemy particles and passes coordinates to lasers
   - Scanning range is 30 pixels or higher?
   100: TGRT, <X:10>0000000000 <Y:10>0000000000
-- NAVI, Navigation
   -- Tells the ship to go somewhere? idk
   -- Different operating modes
   Altitude Control, Stick to coordinate, Maintain distance from enemy
   101: MOVE, <direction:2>00
-- THRS, Thruster, Applies thrust to the ship body
   -- Stores direction thruster has been attached to ship
   -- Calculates by which side of the thruster is more open.
   Draws a fancy cone
   -- Operating capacity depends on how much damage thruster has taken
   


QUANTUM STUFF THIS IS DONE IN CASE U NEED IT 
EXPLAINATION

Particles should also store not only their id, but particle id in state array
- state not only stores vector state, but alos ordering of particles
 - We simply apply identity gate to the one we don't want to change
 - for example, 3 entangled particles, apply H to 2nd, I (X) M (X) I

 swaping is easy, ie swap index 0 and 3 in a 5 qbit state, iterate al lstates, ie
 |00000>, |00001>, ...., find where index 0 and 3 are opposite and swap value with the other state
 ie 00010 swaps with 10000 and 01110 swaps with 11100 and so on
